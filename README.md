# React/Redux App: Would You Rather?

## Project Information

### About

This project was the Redux project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. The application heavily uses Redux and React to simulate the popular "Would You Rather?" game. Users have the option to answer questions, ask new questions, and view leaderboards against other users.

### Concepts

Include information about the concepts, technologies, packages, and frameworks used to develop the project

- React was used to create the UI and compartmentalize various reusable components that were used to construct other pieces of the UI
- Redux was used to create a centralized model of the state and data within the application
- React Router was used to provide URL listeners and assist in allowing the user to navigate to various parts of the application
